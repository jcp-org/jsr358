<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>We briefly discussed difficulty of scheduling meetings at a time that is convenient 
  for all members. Patrick apologized in advance for the likelihood that we will 
  choose a meeting time that does not work for the Nokia members in China, pointing 
  out that meetings in the mid- to late-morning California time are convenient 
  for all but the Chinese members. He promised to work out a mechanism to allow 
  the Chinese members to participate (perhaps by holding occasional extra meetings 
  at 7:00 am California time.) See the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr358/downloads/download/meeting%20materials/jsr358-july31-2012.pdf">JSR 
  358 summary presentation</a> for more information on this and the other procedural 
  matters discussed during this session.</p>
<p>Patrick presented a proposal for standardized terms of Use for JSR collaboration 
  projects (see <a href="http://java.net/projects/jsr358/downloads/download/meeting%20materials/javatou-july21-2012.pdf">presentation</a>.) 
  He explained the necessity of ensuring that &quot;casual&quot; contributions 
  made by non-JCP members through collaborative mechanisms such as public mailing 
  lists and issue-trackers are covered by appropriate IP grants. Members were 
  generally supportive of the proposal. </p>
<p>John Rizzo suggested that when implemented the proposal should advise Spec 
  Leads of the need to prominently remind participants in their work that they 
  are bound by the Terms of Use. Two ways of doing so are by a prominent notice 
  on the project's home page and by posting periodic reminders to the public mailing 
  list. </p>
<p>John Weir noted that the issue of the relationship between employer and employee 
  should be taken into account while developing the Terms of Use. Patrick agreed 
  to link the two issues in the Issue Tracker.</p>
<p>Patrick then led a discussion on the process the Expert Group should follow 
  in order to progress from high-level proposals such as that outlined in the 
  Terms of Use presentation. He noted that he had received no feedback to two 
  questions on patent policy that were posed to the EC mailing list, and that 
  no comments had been received from EC members on the 37 issues he had logged 
  in the Issue Tracker. He said that he understood that consulting internally 
  with corporate lawyers would take time, but argued that it in these cases members 
  should respond that this was what they were doing, and should provide an estimate 
  of when they expected to be able to provide an answer, rather than simply not 
  respond at all.</p>
<p>Steve Wolfe and Dan Bandera noted that it is difficult to get the attention 
  of corporate lawyers unless they are shown specific language to review and critique. 
  Patrick responded that it is inefficient to ask lawyers to draft language for 
  a proposal that may not be acceptable to EG members. Steve Wolfe provided the 
  analogy of a <em>Term Sheet</em> (a concise outline of desired terms and conditions 
  that lawyers can then &quot;execute&quot; by drafting specific language.) He 
  suggested that the Terms of Use presentation could be considered an acceptable 
  Term Sheet, and suggested that Patrick ask the Oracle lawyers to draft language 
  based on it. Patrick agreed that this was a reasonable approach, but reiterated 
  that it would be preferable to have general EG agreement on this before moving 
  forward. He agreed to follow up on this and other unresolved questions by email. 
  He also suggested that we treat this issue as a test-case for how we could reach 
  agreement and move forward on other issues.</p>
<p>[After the meeting Patrick realized that open-ended discussions on the EC mailing 
  list would be inefficient, and instead proposed a process whereby Doodle polls 
  are used to ask members whether they wish to move forward with a particular 
  proposal, to which standardized responses (yes, no, need time to consult internally, 
  need further Expert Group discussion) can be provided. This process is now in 
  trial.] </p>
<p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>
