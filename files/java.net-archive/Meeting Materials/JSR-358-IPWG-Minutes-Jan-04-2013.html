<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>We reviewed the minutes of the last meeting. </p>
<p>Anish introduced rev 3 of the summary doc</p>
<p>Patrick: no reference to rights. Others: in a flat model, the rights can be directly derived from those granted (via obligations)</p>
<p>Patrick: is the list of roles complete?</p>
<p>What about EG members' rights to do &quot;R&amp;D&quot;?</p>
<p>Anish: the table covers final specs</p>
<p>Patrick: we can't ignore non-final. Need a separate table.</p>
<p>Patrick: what about the special rights to Spec Leads (for &quot;deriviative works&quot;?)</p>
<p>Anish: that's covered in the More Details section.</p>
<p><strong>The Spec Lead is just an Implementer, and should get exactly the same rights - no more, no less</strong></p>
<p>SteveH: give time to review docs before meetings.</p>
<p>Patrick: agreed - I should have held off the document since Anish gave it to me just before the meeting.</p>
<p>We then discussed the <em>Standard Licenses</em> portion of the <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/ec-public/materials/2012-11-20/Patent-Altenatives-and-Standard-Licenses.pdf">second IBM presentation</a>.</p>
<p>Patrick asked how we could discuss the outbound obligations to license the RI and TCK without considering the associated inbound grants as they relate to these components. (IBM's proposed &quot;flat IP flow&quot; model addresses only the Spec and explicitly excludes reference to the RI and TCK.) </p>
<p>Two possible alternatives were suggested:</p>
<p>1) Inbound grants should be made under whatever terms the Spec Lead has chosen for the outbound license. </p>
<p>2) A single set of inbound terms could be constructed that would be flexible enough to enable all possible outbound licenses.</p>
<p>Anish and Patrick expressed concerns with both of these approaches, but no resolution was reached. The discussion will be continued during the next meeting.</p>
