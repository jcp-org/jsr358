<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>We had time only to discuss the Hub-and-Spoke proposal.</p>
<p>Steve summarized the goal: IP grants should go directly from contributors
  to implementers/end users rather than through the Spec Lead.</p>
<p>We reviewed the roles listed in the presentation and agreed that two roles
  are missing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distributors - those who (re)distribute what implementers produce.</li>
  <li>Non JCP-members who make casual contributions to the work of an Expert
    Group via online collaborative tools such as discussion forums, mailing lists,
    and issue-trackers.
    <ul>
      <li>This is likely to be covered not by the JSPA but by the proposed standard
        Terms of Use for collaborative JSR projects, but nevertheless should
        be listed for completion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We agreed that it was important to list all roles even if - as we hope - the
  grants by/to several of these will be identical. Listing all will help to assure
  ourselves and others that we've considered all possibilities.</p>
<p>We had a brief discussion about the role of the RI. Patrick maintained that
  the term is overloaded - we use it to refer to a &quot;gold standard&quot; against which
  an implementation can be measured and as the work of the Spec Lead from which
  derivative works can be created. (We have an issue to track this: <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-29">http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-29</a>.)</p>
<p>Steve pointed out that doesn't matter who is the user/consumer or where they
  are in the value-chain - rights are granted to any
<em><strong>compatible implementation</strong></em> </p>
<p>Anish argued that  the Spec Lead gets special rights today and pointed out
  that we need to ensure that rights granted for version 1 of
  a technology (defined in JSR x) will also permit the Spec Lead to incorporate
IP from that JSR into version 2 of the technology (defined in JSR y.) Several
  members argued that this should not be a problem since &quot;by definition&quot; version
  2 of a technology is also <em>Compatible</em> with version 1. Patrick argued
  that on the contrary version 2 is &quot;by definition&quot; <strong>not Compatible</strong>  with
  version 1 (it supersets it.) Later inspection of the JSPA revealed that in
  section 4.A.I.a copyrights and trade secrets are granted for inclusion &quot;into
  current
  and future versions of the Output,&quot; which seems to take care of this issue.
  However, there is no equivalent language in section 4.A.II which covers patent
  grants. An issue has been logged to track this (<a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-44">http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-44</a>)</p>
<p>Gil Tene argued that reciprocity must be mandated. We agreed that this was
  not central to the current discussion. An issue has been logged (<a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-45">http://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-45</a>.)</p>
<p>We began to review the contents of slide 5 line by line. </p>
<p> Gil Tene noted that under the current JSPA the Spec
  Lead plays an aggregator role in the case of RAND grants. After &quot;flattening&quot;
this would be lost. Scott Jameson argued that experience with other standards
  bodies showed that such aggregation is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Patrick noted that the presentation seemed to suggest that those who make
  Contributions have the right to opt-out of essential patent grants. He suggested
  that this is not what the current JSPA says.</p>
<p>We ran out of time for further discussion.</p>
<p>Anish Karmarkar agreed to draft an expanded version of slide 5 in table form,
  for further discussion. We agreed to meet weekly to continue our work.</p>
