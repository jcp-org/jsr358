## **Minutes**

The meeting was very brief since so few members attended and because we will meet again (as the full EC) next Tuesday.

We reviewed the minutes of the last EC meeting, the Action Items.

We reviewed the Doodle poll results. We noted that there is no consensus either way for [Explicit RF patent grants or non-assert covenant?](https://doodle.com/9ms7hch6qyutem4x) and that the "no's" are slightly ahead on [Remove obligation for non-participants to license Patents?](https://doodle.com/ufaidcr828qrpr5x). On both of these, therefore, we will take no action unless things change significantly. On the other hand there is an emerging consensus in favor of [Withdrawal of IP contributions](https://doodle.com/w2htrwvp6ffgcf8w) so we will pursue this further

We reviewed the latest version of the IP-flow document. Patrick reported that he will not be able to take this to Oracle Legal for a couple of weeks, when Don Deutsch will return to the office and will be able to meet with Legal in person.

Finally, Patrick reported that he will review the open issues and assign them to individuals for further investigation where this seems reasonable.

## Next meeting

During the EC teleconference: Tuesday May 12 2015, from 7:00 am to 8:00 am PDT.
