<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>We reviewed  last week's minutes and then continued the discussion of  the version 5 draft of the IP-flow document, focusing again on Essential Patents.</p>
<p>During discussion we answered several of the questions posed in that draft:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do we want to weaken the current section 6 obligations? Yes</li>
  <li>Who has an obligation to disclose? All members, but we will explicitly ask the primary contact.</li>
  <li>Do we want to add an option to &quot;opt out&quot; of the obligation to license as a means of protecting &quot;crown jewels&quot;? Yes</li>
  <li>Is there any obligation to license patents that are <strong>not</strong> disclosed? Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These decisions and other matters we discussed have been incorporated into the next revision of the document which is available <a href="https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/IP-flow-v6.pdf">here</a>. (The document has also been broken down into labeled sub-sections, which will hopefully make it easier to navigate. Some additional questions have also been added.)</p>
<p>Since several of us will be unavailable over the next few weeks we agreed to continue the discussion via email. </p>
<p>The date of the next meeting is TBD - Patrick will discuss/announce via email.</p>
