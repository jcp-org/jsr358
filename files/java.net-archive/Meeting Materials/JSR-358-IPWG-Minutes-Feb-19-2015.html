    <h1 align="center">JSR 358 Working Group Meeting Minutes<br />
      for February 19 2015</h1>
    <h2>Date</h2>
    <p>Thursday 19 February 2015, 9:00-10:00 pm PST</p>
    <h2>Location
    </h2>
    <p>Teleconference</p>
    <h2>Agenda</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-sync: where are we now and what remains to be done?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>As recorded in the minutes from the last two EC meetings, we now have a consensus on RI licensing</li>
        <li>The principal outstanding issues are:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat IP  (addressed in the latest draft of our <a href="The latest version of our summary document: https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf">IP Flow document)</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Where we left this: Oracle Legal said &quot;we can do it, but tell us why it's important&quot;</li>
            <ul>
              <li>We said we would discuss use-cases, but never pursued that</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Essential Patents (also addressed in the latest draft of our <a href="The latest version of our summary document: https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf">IP Flow document)</a></li>
          <ul>
            <li>We did not take this proposal to Oracle Legal</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Ensure that the JSPA does not inhibit or prohibit collaborative RI development and/or open-source licensing (for example, IP vests only after the JSR goes final) </li>
          <ul>
            <li>We have not yet addressed this - how to move forward?</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-84?filter=12196">Review open Issues</a></li>
      <ul>
        What else should we add to our Issue List?
      </ul>
      <li>Next steps: task assignments and plans for future meetings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Minutes</strong>    </h2>
    <p>Patrick summarized where we left things before we embarked on an extensive discussionof RI licensing. He noted that the IP Flow document addresses the two main topics: flat IP flow and patent grants.</p>
    <p>Scott Jameson reminded us that at the London f2f in May 2014 we identified several &quot;use cases&quot; for a flat IP flow. As recorded in the minutes these were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another while a JSR is in progress (perhaps because the original Spec Lead loses interest and the JSR goes dormant).</li>
      <li>Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another after a JSR is completed (for example due to bankruptcy as in the Siemens, BenQ, Qisda case several years ago).</li>
      <li>Incorporating work developed elsewhere without the need to create &quot;side-letters&quot; (see JSRs 235 and 236), making it easier to<em>implement then standardize</em>&nbsp;rather than - as today -&nbsp;<em>standardize then implement</em>.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>On the third topic (ensuring that the JSPA does not inhibit or prohibit collaborative RI development and/or open-source licensing) Patrick wondered whether we need to do much, or whether we can simply say to the lawyers &quot;we don't want this - please fix it&quot;. We agreed that we should perform at least a cursory review of the JSPA before doing so.    </p>
    <p>We then reviewed version 8 of the IP Flow document in detail.</p>
    <p>Patrick noted that we need to distinguish between patents granted with respect to one's own contributions (where the term Essential Patents ought not to be used) and Essential Patents that must be granted with respect to the contributions of others.</p>
  <p>We agreed to poll EC members to ask whether they prefer non-assert covenants to explicit patent grants.</p>
  <p>Patrick noted that whatever we come up with must  give JCP members the option not to license essential patents that they consider &quot;Crown Jewels&quot;.</p>
  <p>We noted that the current JSPA assumes that the deliberations of EGs are &quot;private&quot; (confidential) until Public Review, and public thereafter. This no longer applies in an age of transparency and needs to be fixed.</p>
  <p>We agree that the IP FLow docuent is a decent summary of where we left off but that it probably  needs more work before it's good enought to act as a &quot;Term Sheet&quot; we can take to Legal.</p>
  <p>Scott Jameson pointed out that  we will need to familiarize the new members with this material, and figure out whether they are in agreement.</p>
  <p>Next steps: focus on the IP Flow document. Tighten it up, get a renewed consensus on it (including the new members), work on use cases, and take it to Legal.</p>
  <p>Then (or perhaps in parallel) work through the Issue Tracker, add items as necessary, and prioritize everything as High, Medium, or Low. Assign other items to &quot;volunteers&quot;.</p>
  <p>We will spend the next two meetings  preparing to take this material to the  EC meeting on March 10.</p>
  <p>Scott pointed out that we need IBM's participation. Patrick agreed to follow up with Steve Wolfe. [He did so, and Steve promised to attend future meetings.]</p>
