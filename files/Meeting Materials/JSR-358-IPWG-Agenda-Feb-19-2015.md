### Agenda

*   Re-sync: where are we now and what remains to be done?

*   As recorded in the minutes from the last two EC meetings, we have a consensus on RI licensing
*   The principal outstanding issues:

*   Flat IP (addressed in the latest draft of our [IP Flow document)](https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf)

*   Where we left this: Oracle Legal said "we can do it, but tell us why it's important"

*   We said we would discuss use-cases, but never pursued that

*   Essential Patents (also addressed in the latest draft of our [IP Flow document)](https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/IP-flow-v8.pdf)

*   We did not take this proposal to Oracle Legal

*   Ensure that the JSPA does not inhibit or prohibit collaborative RI development and/or open-source licensing (for example, IP vests only after the JSR goes final)

*   We have not yet addressed this - how to move forward?

*   [Review open Issues](https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-84?filter=12196)

*   Next steps: task assignments and plans for future meetings
