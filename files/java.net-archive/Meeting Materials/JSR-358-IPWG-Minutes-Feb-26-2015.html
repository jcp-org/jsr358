    <h2><strong>Minutes</strong>    </h2>
    <p>We reviewed minutes of last week's meeting.</p>
    <p>We reviewed the IP-flow document again to verify whether we wish to make any further changes to it before we take it back to the full EC for further discussion. We decided it's good enough in its current form. We will discuss the document at the March 10 EC meeting </p>
    <p>During the review Patrick raised the concern that Mike Milinkovich had expressed that switching our patent policy from Royalty-Free to a non-assert mode might limit or eliminate the possibility of using defensive termination (see <a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-25">https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-25</a>). Anish Karmarkar pointed us to three IPR policies that combine non-assert with defensive termination (links are provided in the issue) so it seems that Mike's concern is unfounded.    </p>
    <p>We then reviewed our open issues.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-23">issue 23</a>: Patrick will find a volunteer to review the JSPA looking for language that inhibits transparency. </li>
      <li><a href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-45">issue 45</a>: Gil Tene opened this with no content. Patrick will ask him to modify the issue to document his concern.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patrick agreed to look for other  &quot;low-hanging-fruit&quot; issues that can also be assigned to someone for investigation. He  encouraged others to review the existing issues and to log new ones where necessary. He noted that we don't seem to have logged issues relating to standard licenses. He will do so.  Scott Stark suggested that we need to discuss the language on licensing and platform inclusion that we will include in the Spec Lead Guide. Patrick will open an issue for this.</p>
    <p>Tasks for next week's meeting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare for the full EC meeting on March 10.</li>
      <li>Review the Flat IP use-cases we came up with last year (documented in last week's minutes) and prepare to discuss/add new cases.    </li>
    </ul>
