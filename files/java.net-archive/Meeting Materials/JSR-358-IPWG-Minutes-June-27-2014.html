<h2><strong>Transcript</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> apologized       for not providing a written response in advance of the meeting.<br />
  He recognizes he won't be able to address everyone's concerns, but       has a proposal that he hopes will address many of them.<br />
  Two changes:<br />
  1) Remove reference to current and future versions from the       license - this can be placed in the Larger Works (LW) file if       necessary<br />
  2) Recognizing that some have interpreted the UPL draft as       granting patent rights (as well as copyright) for derivative       works, he is willing to clarify (the intent was only copyright).<br />
  He had considered Azul's suggestion that LW should include       &quot;Compatible implementations of this JSR&quot; but is now disinclined to       use this language since he believes many do not want to make       patent grants to any compatible implementation, particularly with       respect to non-Essential patents.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Eileen:</strong> why not just use Apache?<strong><br />
  <br />
  Jim: </strong>we're trying to solve for multiple uses. We need a       purely-GPL compatible solution. Apache is not compatible. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Eileen:</strong> So Apache is a non-starter? Maybe we can       discuss this offline?<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff</strong><strong>: </strong>What are your concerns about Apache? What       makes it incompatible with GPL? We want defensive termination (DT)       - and it's precisely this that makes Apache incompatible with GPL.       So that problem can't be solved.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim</strong>: the Spec License is a separate matter...<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> You seem to be incorporating some Spec-license-like       stuff into the UPL.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>The LW file could say &quot;JSR X&quot;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> That's a Spec-license type of commitment - should be       covered by the JSPA.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim:</strong> The LW could say &quot;just the RI for JSR X&quot; - then the       grants would not extend beyond the RI.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> We're happy to make patent grants with respect to our       contributions. We don't want a broad commitment with respect to       others' contributions (referencing our Essential or even       non-Essential patents) without a DT clause.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim</strong>: I'm more concerned about people in this room suing       each other than about outsiders...<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong>&nbsp; IBM has long believed that the Essential Patent       grant should be RF rather than RAND. DT is the reason we're       incompatible with the GPL so you're stuck with that.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>Grants wouldn't extend beyond the RI to other       (Independent) implementations.<br />
  <strong><br />
  Jeff:</strong> Would Oracle be willing to contribute to a project       under the UPL?<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>Yes.<br />
  <strong><br />
  Eileen:</strong><strong> </strong>The Apache license is well established - it       has a DT clause.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>It's not generically GPL compatible...<br />
  <strong><br />
  Eileen:</strong> What about GPL v3?<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>We're committed to V2.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> You could use BSD and make the patent licenses       explicit in the JSPA.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>Then we wouldn't need this license at all - the JSPA       would be sufficient. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff</strong>:<strong> </strong>You are relicensing under the GPL code that       IBM contributed under terms that include DT. Are you violating the       GPL? I don't think so.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim:</strong> Hmmm...<br />
  <br />
  [More exchanges between Jim and Jeff that I didn't catch.]<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>We considered an empty LW file but we wanted to       extend the grants to the final released version of the RI (and not       have them limited to the state of the project at the time of the       contribution).<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Eileen:</strong> We'd like to see defensive termination.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>Very few people are hung up on defensive termination.<br />
  <strong><br />
  Nissa:</strong> Why not have people contribute under Apache with an       &quot;Exception&quot; in which they explicitly grant permission for their       contributions to be relicensed under GPL?<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim:</strong> We want something more general - must be relicensable       on any terms.... We're not going to change our outbound licensing       model.... We can have more offline discussions if you want.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Eileen:</strong> OK.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim:</strong> Bear in mind that there will be an &quot;interface&quot; between       this and the JSPA.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Steve Harris: </strong>Given an &quot;interface&quot; I don't see       why you can't just accept Apache.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Don:&nbsp; </strong>For those of you who contribute to open-source       forges ... Do the contribution agreements typically have DT       clauses? I see the need for them from an SSO perspective but maybe       in the open source world grants are broader.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim:</strong> It depends on the license - some OS licenses have DT,       some don't.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Eileen: </strong>The OS activities HP contributes to typically do       have DT (eg. Open Stack, which is Apache-licensed).<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> For IBM also the answer is typically &quot;yes&quot;, though we       also sometimes contribute under MIT.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff: </strong>All the code Oracle has received under the JSPA was       contributed under terms that included DT. This is functionally       equivalent to accepting code under Apache.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jim: </strong>Just because we've done something less than ideal in       the past that doesn't mean we will continue to do it that way in       the future.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Jeff:</strong> We've been doing business this way for 20 years...<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Steve Harris: </strong>One of our goals when we started this       exercise was to use a <strong>familar</strong> license. Apache is the       obvious way to go. We're trying to solve a problem that only Jim       (Oracle) cares about.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Mike DeNicola:</strong> I want to know what problem we're trying to       solve...<br />
  <br />
<strong>Steve Harris: </strong>Using Apache seems to be off the       table from Oracle's perspective...</p>
<p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Jim:  can you clarify if  that's so, and why? Also, it would be good if Jeff or someone else would       write up the Apache proposal - explaining why they think it's       feasible. We also need to see Jim's revised UPL proposal, and it would be helpful to have a written explanation of Oracle's objections to       using Apache.<br />
