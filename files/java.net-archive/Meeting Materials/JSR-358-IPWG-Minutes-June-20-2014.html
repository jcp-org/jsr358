<h2><strong>Minutes</strong></h2>
<p><strong>HP</strong><br />
  <br />
Is concerned generally about license proliferation. Fears that UPL       may encourage &quot;downstream&quot; license proliferation due to its       perceived defects.<br />
1. Explicit patent grants are fine, but the UPL is far too broad.<br />
2. Lack of defensive termination.<br />
3. &quot;Future versions&quot; language is potentially problematic       depending on what is in the Larger Works file<br />
Assumes that the right to opt-out of patent grants will           be specified in the JSPA.<br />
<br />
What problem are we trying to solve?<br />
<br />
Patrick provided a quick       summary: we're looking for a license that will permit Oracle to       incorporate &quot;third-party RIs&quot; into the platform and then       re-license both commercially and under GPL.<br />
<br />
We noted that Eclipse projects would         have to be dual-licensed under EPL and UPL.<br />
Dual-licensing would also be required for RIs developed at         Apache.<br />
<br />
<strong>IBM</strong><br />
<br />
Agrees with all of HP's concerns re broad patent grants<br />
Happy to contribute to conformant implementations, but are       concerned about broader grants.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Need to discuss not just whether UPL is a good license...<br />
Is it an appropriate license for the JCP?<strong><br />
</strong>We're hoping to implement a flat IP flow<br />
Will Oracle license RIs under UPL?<br />
<br />
Patrick: Oracle will continue to license RIs under GPL + ClassPath       Exception<br />
Jim: Oracle does intend to use it to license other items<br />
<br />
The goal was to have a single license that everyone would use<br />
Would Oracle be comfortable contributing under this license?<br />
<br />
What will be in the Larger Works file?<br />
If it says &quot;Java SE&quot; then all Oracle's patents would be &quot;open&quot;<br />
<br />
Nobody within the JCP would be able to assert a patent. <br />
This is potentially a good thing.<br />
However, it does nothing to protect JCP members against third       parties who assert against us.<br />
<br />
<strong>Red Hat</strong><br />
<br />
Concerned that this license will not encourage open-source RI       projects<br />
Want multiple participants in those projects. An unfamiliar       license (with very broad patent grants) might discourage       participation.<br />
Wouldn't be too concerned if Oracle also used this license but it       seems they won't.<br />
If Larger Works says &quot;Java, now and in the future&quot; that would be       extremely broad.<br />
&quot;Java&quot; is open to interpretation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Software AG<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>Want to see specific examples of contents of Larger Works       file.<br />
<br />
<strong>Azul<br />
<br />
</strong>Wants a flat model (inbound/outbound)<br />
Summarizes current grants (in JSPA)<br />
People seem to be comfortable with Royalty Free grants for       contributions.<br />
Larger Works file should specify just the RI being worked on.<br />
Should not be modifiable in future.<br />
Jim: we don't expect that it can be modified.<strong></strong><br />
<br />
Larger Works file should say &quot;compatible implementations of JSR X&quot;<br />
Should not go beyond what the JSPA says today.<br />
Whatever we come up with should incorporate compatibility       requirements<br />
<br />
UPL has very broad patent grant.<br />
Seems to extend to derivative works.<br />
<br />
<strong>CloudBees<br />
<br />
</strong>How can OS projects evolve/be forked in context of Larger       Works (unknown - could get very messy)<br />
Question for Oracle Legal: please explain why Apache license is       unacceptable to you<br />
