### Agenda

*   Review [minutes of last week's meeting](https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/JSR-358-IPWG-Minutes-Feb-26-2015.md)
*   Flat IP flow
    *   Definition
    *   Use-cases

    *   Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another while a JSR is in progress (perhaps because the original Spec Lead loses interest and the JSR goes dormant).
    *   Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another after a JSR is completed (for example due to bankruptcy as in the Siemens, BenQ, Qisda case several years ago).
    *   Incorporating work developed elsewhere without the need to create "side-letters" (see JSRs 235 and 236), making it easier to_implement then standardize_ rather than - as today - _standardize then implement_.

*   Prep for March 10 EC meeting
*   Next steps
