## **Agenda**

*   [IBM: Patent alternatives and standard licenses](/files/Meeting%20Materials/Patent-Altenatives-and-Standard-Licenses.pdf)

## Minutes

Steve Wolfe presented a proposal for an alternative to the current essential patent grants and for standardized licensing terms ([see the presentation](/files/Meeting%20Materials/Patent-Altenatives-and-Standard-Licenses.pdf).) Scott Jameson responded that the proposed alternative essential patent grants would not make things easier for HP since they would still want to carry out a full search for relevant patents due to the vagueness of the term "known." Don Deutsch agreed to inform the EG whether Oracle was willing to investigate the possibility of using standardized licenses. There was no time for further discussion, and we agreed to follow up at a future meeting.
