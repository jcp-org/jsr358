### Agenda

*   Review [minutes of last week's meeting](https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Meeting%20Materials/JSR-358-IPWG-Minutes-March-5-2015.md)
*   Review [Action Items](https://java.net/jira/browse/JSR358-90?filter=12420)
*   Review the new [IP-Flow document](https://java.net/downloads/jsr358/Working%20Documents/IP-flow-v10.pdf)
*   Wording for Doodle polls on patent policy
*   Flat IP flow
    *   Use-cases

    *   Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another while a JSR is in progress (perhaps because the original Spec Lead loses interest and the JSR goes dormant).
    *   Transferring IP from one Spec Lead to another after a JSR is completed (for example due to bankruptcy as in the Siemens, BenQ, Qisda case several years ago).
    *   Incorporating work developed elsewhere without the need to create "side-letters" (see JSRs 235 and 236), making it easier to _implement then standardize_ rather than - as today - _standardize then implement_.

    *   Review the [side-letter](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/JCP_SCLA.pdf) that was used for JSRs 235 and 236\. Is this issue still important? If so, how will a flat IP-policy help?

    *   Enable a member who is not the Spec Lead to apply defensive termination against someone who initiates litigation alleging patent infringement.

*   Next steps
