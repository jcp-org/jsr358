1. Definitions, skipped
<p>2. Participation<br>
  A. The Process. A process by which the Java platform evolves has been defined 
  by community members and is available at http://jcp.org, and the JSPA supersedes 
  the process in the event of a conflict. Terms in the JSPA not defined in Section 
  1 are defined in the process document.</p>
<p> B. Evolution of Agreement. Members involved in updating the Java platform 
  via the JSR process should execute a JSPA agreement, and can elect to agree 
  to a newer version as it becomes available.</p>
<p>3. Process Cost Sharing. The following annual fee for each category of participation 
  is due 30 days from execution of the agreement:<br>
  Commercial Entity: $5,000.00/year<br>
  Education, Government, non-profit organization: $2,000.00/year<br>
  Fee Bearing Java Technology Source Code Licensees of Oracle: $0.00<br>
  Individual representing self only: $0.00</p>
<p>4. Intellectual Property; In-Bound<br>
  A. Contributions to the Spec Lead. With respect to the Output of a JSR, you 
  grant to each Spec Lead/Maintenance Lead for each Expert Group for which You 
  are not the Spec Lead, a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, 
  fully paid-up and, subject to Section 4.D, irrevocable, license, with the right 
  to sublicense:<br>
  I. Copyrights and Trade Secrets. Under Your applicable copyrights and trade 
  secret rights which You currently have or may acquire in the future, to:<br>
  (a) incorporate any and all Contributions provided by You into current and future 
  versions of the Output;<br>
  (b) copy, disclose and distribute the Contributions provided by You as part 
  of the Spec for Community Review and Public Review and as part of the early 
  access versions of the RI and TCK; and<br>
  (c) copy, modify, develop, disclose and distribute the Contributions provided 
  by You, all as part of the Output, on terms consistent with those specified 
  in Section 5 below.</p>
<p>Works created by employees of the Federal Government are not subject to copyright 
  protection within the United States and may be copied or used by interested 
  parties.</p>
<p> II. Patents<br>
  (a) You grant patent rights you now have or acquire in the future with respect 
  to Contributions which are made by You, as part of the Output, with the right 
  to sublicense, on terms consistent with those specified in Section 5 below, 
  including the right to implement such Contribution as part of a compatible implementation 
  of the Specification, per Section 5.B or 5.F respectively, under all of Your 
  patent claims whose infringement cannot be avoided in a technically feasible 
  manner when implementing the Specification. This will terminate if a sublicensee 
  initiates a claim against you.</p>
<p> (b) For Contributions which You make but not in a recorded form, the provisions 
  of Section 6, and not this Section 4.A.II, shall apply, subject to any additional 
  obligations You may have as the Spec Lead pursuant to Section 5. The Spec. Lead 
  may sublicense or assign any or all of the rights granted to it in this Section 
  4.A to a subcontractor for the development of the Output.</p>
<p> B. Grants to Other Expert Group Members. You grant to Member represented on 
  any Expert Group on which You participate Your applicable patents, copyrights 
  and trade secret rights which You currently have or may acquire in the future, 
  a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable 
  license to use Your Contributions for research and development purposes related 
  to the activities of such Expert Group. Similarly, Oracle makes the same grant 
  to You with respect to its Contributions concerning Expert Groups on which You 
  are represented. These grants, from You to other Members and from Oracle to 
  You, shall not include distribution to third parties of early access implementations 
  of the Spec under development by Your Expert Group until the draft Spec has 
  been released for Public Review.</p>
<p> C. Contributions from Oracle and Ex-Spec Leads. Oracle grants the same license 
  as does any other member with respect to its Contributions pursuant to Section 
  4.A to a Spec Lead. If You cease to be the Spec Lead before a JSR is completed, 
  then any and all of the comments, specifications, materials or ideas provided 
  by You, to the extent incorporated into any form of Output, shall be considered 
  Contributions licensed pursuant to Sections 4.A and 4.B.</p>
<p> D. Withdrawal of Contributions due to Change in Announced License Terms. If 
  the Spec Lead for an Expert Group in which You are participating makes significant 
  changes to the terms and conditions of any license granted pursuant to Sections 
  5.B or 5.F below after those terms and conditions are first disclosed pursuant 
  to the Process, then You may, upon giving notice to the Specification Lead and 
  the PMO, withdraw any copyright or patent licenses concerning Your Contributions 
  granted pursuant to Section 4.A.I or 4.A.II<br>
  above (but not patent licenses granted by You pursuant to Section 6 below).</p>
<p>5. Intellectual Property; Out-Bound.<br>
  A. Ownership; Obligation to Publish Spec. Spec Lead(s) for a particular JSR 
  at the time of the final release of the Specification shall own the copyright 
  to the final Spec generated pursuant to that JSR under United States copyright 
  law. Promptly after its completion (i.e. passes Final Approval Ballot), such 
  Spec will be published by the PMO at the JCP Web Site.</p>
<p> B. License to Create Independent Implementations. For any Specification produced 
  under a new JSR, the Spec Lead for such JSR shall offer to grant a perpetual, 
  non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, irrevocable license under 
  its licensable copyrights in and patent claims covering the Specification (including 
  rights licensed to the Spec Lead pursuant to Section 4.A and 4.C) to anyone 
  who wishes to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the 
  Spec. Such license will authorize the creation and distribution of Independent 
  Implementations provided such Independent Implementations:<br>
  (a) fully implement the Spec(s) including all its required interfaces and functionality;<br>
  (b) do not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, 
  or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields 
  or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized 
  by the Spec or Specs being implemented; and<br>
  (c) pass the TCK for such Spec.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Section 5.B, patent claims covering the Specification 
  shall mean any claims for which there is no technically feasible way of avoiding 
  infringement in the course of implementing the specification.</p>
<p> C. Reciprocity.<br>
  I. The Spec Lead may condition its offer of the license described in Section 
  5.B upon its licensee&#8217;s commitment to offer to any party seeking a license 
  from such licensee, if requested, a license under such licensee&#8217;s patent 
  rights which are or would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations 
  of the Spec on terms consistent with the provisions of Section 6.A excluding, 
  for non-Members, its subsections (bb) and (ee).<br>
  II. The Spec Lead also may condition its offer of the license described in Section 
  5.B on a licensee not initiating a claim that the Spec Lead, has, in the course 
  of performing its responsibilities as the Spec Lead, caused any infringement 
  of the licensee's patent rights.<br>
  III. No provision of this Section 5.C shall be construed to compel, restrict 
  or limit the terms on which the Spec Lead may grant or offer to grant patent 
  licenses that are non-essential to implementation of a specification.<br>
  <br>
  Other than as set forth above, the Spec Lead agrees not to impose any contractual 
  condition that would limit the right of any licensee to create or distribute 
  such Independent Implementations. The Spec License may otherwise include as 
  additional terms and conditions only those that do not relate to the license 
  grant but govern issues such as confidentiality, applicable law, dispute resolution, 
  export control and government rights in data provisions, warranties and liabilities. 
  In addition, the Spec Lead for each JSR hereby agrees that it will not use the 
  rights granted or licensed to it under another JSR that does not satisfy the 
  requirements of subparagraphs (a) through (c) above.</p>
<p> D. Continued Availability. If a Specification produced under a new or revised 
  Umbrella JSR include a JSR previously available as an Independent Implementation 
  (&#8220;Stand-Alone Component&#8221;), then the Spec Lead for the Stand-Alone 
  Component may determine in accordance with the Process whether or not to make 
  the Stand-Alone Component available for Independent Implementation in its revised 
  form as publicized under the Umbrella JSR. The Spec Lead for the Stand-Alone 
  Component shall not restrict the right of a third party to create an Independent 
  Implementation of the most recent prior version of the Stand-Alone Component.</p>
<p> E. Downstream Licenses for Independent Implementations. A Downstream Licensee 
  need not include any particular &#8220;pass through&#8221; requirements in any 
  license the Downstream Licensee grants concerning the use of its Independent 
  Implementation or products derived from it. However, except with respect to 
  implementations of the Specification by the Downstream Licensee&#8217;s licensee 
  that satisfy the full JSPA requirements, the Downstream Licensee may neither: 
  (i) grant or otherwise pass through to its licensees any licensable copyrights 
  and patent rights of the Spec Lead; nor (ii) authorize its licensees to make 
  any claims concerning their implementation&#8217;s compliance with the Spec 
  in question.</p>
<p> F. Licensing of RI and TCK.<br>
  I. The Spec Lead (including Oracle) for a JSR approved by the JCP shall offer 
  to any interested party licenses to the RI and TCK on terms that are non-discriminatory, 
  fair and reasonable. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 5.F, such 
  terms and conditions shall be determined by the Spec Lead in its reasonable 
  discretion.</p>
<p> II. With respect to the RI, the terms and conditions offered by the Spec Lead 
  shall include, at a minimum:<br>
  (a) the right to copy, modify the source code portions of (excluding any Shared 
  Code, except as provided for in Section 5.G) and distribute the RI, in whole 
  or in part, as part of a complete binary implementation of the corresponding 
  Spec that satisfies requirements (a) &#8211; (c) of Section 5.B; and<br>
  (b) patent grants to allow the right to make, have made, use, offer to sell, 
  sell or import such implementation.</p>
<p> III. With respect to the TCK when licensed separately from the RI, for a Qualified 
  Not-for-Profit or Qualified Individual there shall be no charge for the license 
  offered by the Spec Lead.</p>
<p> IV. If the Spec Lead limits the scope of the licenses granted according to 
  this Section 5.F, there are certain restriction on how limiting the license 
  can be. None of this applies to existing Oracle RI/TCK licensing agreements, 
  and does not imply Oracle needs to change those in the future.</p>
<p> V. The Spec Lead is not required to license the RI (or TCK) in source code 
  form, but this does not relieve the Spec Lead of its obligations concerning 
  the RI and the TCK under the Process.</p>
<p> VI. The Spec Lead may license the RI and Spec on terms and conditions consistent 
  with Section 5.B(a)-(c), that allow implementation of the Spec to incorporate 
  parts of the RI that are not Shared Code.</p>
<p> G. Shared Code. For Specs developed under new JSRs, if it is determined in 
  accordance with the Process that a fully compatible implementation of the Spec 
  cannot be achieved without use of code from the RI, then the Spec Lead shall 
  grant a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free license 
  under its applicable intellectual property rights to allow anyone to incorporate 
  the Shared Code as part of an Independent Implementation of the Spec that satisfies 
  requirements (a)-(c) of Section 5.B. Such license may<br>
  not authorize the licensee to modify the Shared Code except to the extent necessary 
  to enable its incorporation into the licensee&#8217;s Independent Implementation.</p>
<p> H. Admission Against Interest. Oracle acknowledges that Your entering into 
  this Agreement shall not prevent any defenses that against a claim that you 
  infringed on Oracle&#8217;s or a third party&#8217;s copyright of the Specification.</p>
<p>6. Special Patent Considerations.<br>
  A. Grant. With respect to the Output of JSRs for which You are not the Spec 
  Lead, You agree to patent grants, after adoption of the Spec, to all licensees 
  under Section 5 and on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms a perpetual, 
  non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license within the scope of the licenses 
  granted in Sections 5.B and 5.F to:<br>
  (a) use the TCK; and<br>
  (b) where there is no technically feasible alternative that would avoid infringing 
  the patent claim, either use the licensed RI, in whole or in part, as part of 
  an implementation of the Spec(s) in question that satisfies requirements (a)&#8211;(c) 
  of Section 5.B or develop, distribute, and use an Independent Implementation;</p>
<p>However, You shall not be required to grant a license:<br>
  (aa) to a licensee not willing to grant a reciprocal license under its patent 
  rights to You and to any other party seeking interested in the enforcement of 
  such licensee&#8217;s patent claims;<br>
  (bb) if the Spec arises from a JSR for which Community Review has closed after 
  termination of your membership in the JCP;<br>
  (cc) to any portion of any product which is not required in order to be fully 
  compliant with the Spec;<br>
  (dd) to technology that is not required for at least one of the following: using 
  the Reference Implementation, using the TCK, or developing, distributing or 
  using an Independent Implementation; or<br>
  (ee) if, with respect to the Spec (or RI or TCK) in question, You identify prior 
  to Public Review a perceived infringement and disclose in writing to the Spec 
  Lead and the PMO the details of the relevant patent.</p>
<p>Subject to Section 6.C below, the provisions required of and extended to You 
  under this Section 6.A shall apply to Oracle with respect to Specifications 
  under JSRs for which Oracle is not the Spec Lead.</p>
<p> B. Disclosure. In addition to the disclosure requirements of Section 6.A(ee), 
  each individual who represents a Member on an Expert Group shall disclose to 
  that Expert Group promptly after he or she becomes aware of any issued patents 
  the infringement of which, to the individual&#8217;s actual knowledge, cannot 
  be avoided in a technically feasible manner in order to implement such Spec.</p>
<p> C. Effect on Existing Agreements. No provision of this Section 6 shall be 
  understood to require Oracle to modify license agreements for Java technology 
  that Oracle has in place, or to modify or replace in future license agreements 
  for Java technology provisions comparable to those currently in place.</p>
<p>7. No Obligations. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement, does 
  not obligate you to license terms, patent terms, etc.</p>
<p>8. Use of Trademarks. Unless you have a superseding agreement, You may refer 
  to Oracle&#8217;s Java technology or programming language as given in The Third 
  Party Usage Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks are currently available on the 
  web at http://www.oracle.com/html/3party.html.</p>
<p>9. Confidentiality. Obsolete section.</p>
<p>10. Term and Termination. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date 
  and, unless terminated earlier by You by written notice, continue for a period 
  of one (1) year, and shall automatically renew each anniversary date thereafter 
  until either party provides notice to the other of its intent to terminate the 
  Agreement at least sixty (60) days prior to the next anniversary date. Section 
  13 shall continue to apply with respect to JSRs commenced during the term of 
  this Agreement. Each version of this Agreement shall continue to apply with 
  respect to any JSR approved for development while such version was in effect.</p>
<p>11. Publicity. Obsolete section.</p>
<p>12. Disclaimer of Warranties and Special Damages. Boiler plate disclaimer.</p>
<p>13. Survival. The parties&#8217; obligations under Sections 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 
  and 12 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>
<p>14. Government Employees. Terms of this Agreement are applicable to United 
  States Federal employees or agencies to the extent that they do not conflict 
  with Federal law or regulation, and if You are a Federal agency You agree to 
  exercise whatever discretion granted to You by federal law and regulation to 
  make such patent rights available on terms consistent with the principles of 
  this Agreement.</p>
<p>15. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A, constitutes the entire 
  agreement between the parties concerning its subject matter with respect to 
  any JSR commenced after the Effective Date, except for any license agreement 
  between You and Oracle concerning its Java technology, which shall take precedence 
  to the extent of any conflict between its intellectual property terms and those 
  of this Agreement. Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by 
  California law, excluding choice of law rules, provided, however that neither 
  party has consented to the jurisdiction of any court located in the other party&acute;s 
  country of incorporation.</p>
